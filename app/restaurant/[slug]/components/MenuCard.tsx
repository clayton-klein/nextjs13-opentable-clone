        A burrito is a dish in Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine that took form in
        Ciudad Ju√°rez, consisting of a flour tortilla wrapped into a sealed
        cylindrical shape around various ingredients. The tortilla is sometimes
        lightly grilled or steamed to soften it, make it more pliable, and allow
        it to adhere to itself.
